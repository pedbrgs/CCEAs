    Evaluate selected features based on the predictive performance of a machine learning model.

    Attributes
    ----------
    model_evaluator: object of one of the metrics classes
        Responsible for computing performance metrics to evaluate models.
    base_model: sklearn model object
        Model that has not been fitted. Works as a template to avoid multiple model
        initializations. As each model evaluates a subset of features (individual), the base model
        is copied and fitted for each individual.
    model: sklearn model object
        Model that has been fitted to evaluate the individual.
