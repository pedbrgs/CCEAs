    Randomly initialize subpopulations with a binary representation.

    Attributes
    ----------
    subpops: list
        Individuals from all subpopulations. Each individual is represented by a binary
        n-dimensional array, where n is the number of features. If there is a 1 in the i-th
        position of the array, it indicates that the i-th feature should be considered and if
        there is a 0, it indicates that the feature should not be considered.
    fobjs: list
        Evaluation of all individuals from all subpopulations.
    context_vectors: list
        Complete problem solutions that were randomly initialized.
